"""
A script to extract text from a PDF document using pymupdf4llm, optimized
for speed using multi-processing.

This script processes pages in parallel to significantly speed up extraction,
measures the total time taken, calculates the average time per page, and
saves the extracted text in Markdown format.

Installation:
    pip install pymupdf4llm pymupdf

Usage:
    python extract_and_time.py /path/to/your/document.pdf
